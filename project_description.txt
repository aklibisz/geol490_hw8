PROJECT DESCRIPTION

Part 1: Create a Shiny data explorer app under git version control

The assigment is simple: 
Create a data explorer app in Shiny (i.e., an app to interactively visualize a data frame). 
You can recreate the app that I have shown in class (git repo here; hosted on shinyapps.io here). 
Better yet, find your own dataset and create an analagous data explorer app that does the following:

- Has a range slider
- Allows the user to select which column to map to which aesthetic
- Doesn’t create the plot until the user presses a “go” button
- Build the app piece-by-piece, under git version control

You should build up the app piece-by-piece, as we have done in class. We will know that you have done it that way, because your app should:

- have a git repository
- the git repository should be on github
- there should be a record of your development in the git commits, each of which should have a clear, informative commit message

Part 2: Improve your partner’s app

Find a partner, and make a meaningful (if small) change to their app. Do this as follows:

- fork their github repo
- git clone your fork of their repo to your computer
- make some changes and commit them
- git push origin master your repo back to github
- issue a pull request using the button on github
- your partner should accept the pull request and successfully incorporate the change

Note: All this will be much easier if you and your partner agree on the timing: 
the partner should not make changes to their shiny app while you are forking, cloning, pushing, and issuing the pull request. 
Otherwise you may encounter git conflicts, which can be a pain to resolve.
